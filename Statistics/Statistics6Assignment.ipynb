In a one-tailed test, the critical region (the region of rejection) is located on one side of the sampling distribution.\n",

    "Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference in reaction time between participants who consumed caffeine and those who did not consume caffeine. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that there is a significant difference in reaction time between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0 (no significant difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ha: μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0 (significant difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "where μ1 is the population mean reaction time for participants who consumed caffeine and μ2 is the population mean reaction time for participants who did not consume caffeine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Set the level of significance.\n",
    "The significance level (α) is 0.1 (90% confidence level).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate the test statistic.\n",
    "We can use the t-test formula to calculate the test statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (x̄1 - x̄2) / (s / sqrt(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "where x̄1 is the sample mean reaction time for participants who consumed caffeine, x̄2 is the sample mean reaction time for participants who did not consume caffeine, s is the pooled standard deviation, and n is the sample size (30).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to calculate the pooled standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = sqrt(((n1 - 1)s1^2 + (n2 - 1)s2^2) / (n1 + n2 - 2))\n",
    "s = sqrt(((29)(0.05)^2 + (29)(0.05)^2) / (30 + 30 - 2))\n",
    "s = 0.0505\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (0.25 - 0) / (0.0505 / sqrt(30))\n",
    "t = 15.28\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate the critical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value for a two-tailed test with a 90% confidence level and 28 degrees of freedom (30 - 2) is ±1.699.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Make a decision and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculated t-value (15.28) is greater than the critical value (±1.699), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in reaction time between participants who consumed caffeine and those who did not consume caffeine at a 90% confidence level. In other words, caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time in this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we could also calculate the p-value associated with the calculated t-value using a t-distribution table or calculator. The p-value in this case is much smaller than the significance level (α = 0.1), providing further evidence to reject the null hypothesis."
